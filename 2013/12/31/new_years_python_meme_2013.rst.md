This is the last year's one:

1. What’s the coolest Python application, framework or library you have discovered in 2013 ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Kaa](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/kaaedit) is the coolest application.
This is a CUI editor written in Python3.3. It is easy to use and useful,
so I changed to use it on a routine basis. The development of kaa is
very active, a new version is available almost everyday. Check out [the
version history](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/kaaedit#version-history).

I'm checking a Webframe work named
[morepath](https://github.com/morepath/morepath), too.

2. What new programming technique did you learn in 2013 ?
---------------------------------------------------------

I learned how to distribute packages, creating libraries and Web
frameworks. And learned the basics of Python, HTTP and WSGI. Last year,
I didn't know about them. just I created own Web applications using some
frameworks. I aimed to learn them, written in 2012's python meme. All of
things I created and contributed are available on next section.

3. Which open source project did you contribute to the most in 2012 ? What did you do ?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

May be Django. This year I joined one of django authors.

Or, [Uiro framework](https://uiro.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

And I created many libraries this year:

4. Which Python blog or website did you read the most in 2013 ?
---------------------------------------------------------------

-   Reddit, especially [/r/python](http://www.reddit.com/r/python), and
    [/r/django](http://www.reddit.com/r/django).

5. What are the three top things you want to learn in 2014 ?
------------------------------------------------------------

1.  English:

> Next year, I will join to
> [EuroPython2014](https://ep2014.europython.eu/en/). This will be the
> first time to join another country's event. I will learn about English
> in order to enjoy this event much more. I listen to [VOA Leaning
> English](http://learningenglish.voanews.com/) these days.

2.  How to keep developing and improving one project:

> This year I created many packages, but almost of them are left alone.
> And I learned that the first release is not so important. To create
> effective and useful software, it is necessary to keep creating and
> improving.

3.  Not only Web. I've learned about Web programming for about 2 years:

> This year, I will try to create something not relating Web. For the
> first step, now I'm creating
> [genaa](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/genaa), a command line tool.

6. What is the top software, application or library you wish someone would write in 2014 ?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[genaa](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/genaa) is.

And some Web applications or libraries for Pyramid, not only Django.

I learned many things in 2013. I wish I would write more interesting
things in 2014. Have a good holiday.
